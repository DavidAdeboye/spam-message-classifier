ðŸ”§ How It Works

1. Text Cleaning:
   ```python
   def preprocess_text(text):
       text = text.lower()
       text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
       return ' '.join(text.split())
   ```

2. Feature Extraction:
   ```python
   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(
       stop_words='english',
       max_features=5000
   )
   ```

3. Classification:
   ```python
   classifier = MultinomialNB(alpha=0.1)
   model = Pipeline([
       ('tfidf', vectorizer),
       ('clf', classifier)
   ])
   ```

ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Setup:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo>
   cd spam-classifier
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Train Model:
   ```bash
   python spam_classifier.py
   ```

3. Launch App:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
